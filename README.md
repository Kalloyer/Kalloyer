## **Telecom Customer Churn Analysis**
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn (turnover) in a telecommunications company. We used **SQL** for data exploration, **Python** for analysis and predictive modeling, and **Power BI** and **Tableau** for data visualization.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Data Exploration with SQL:**
  - Calculated the overall churn rate.
  - Investigated the relationship between tenure (time as a customer) and churn.
  - Identified the most used payment methods among churned customers.
  - Analyzed customers with all services contracted, without internet connection, and those who opted for digital billing.

- **Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling with Python:**
  - Explored the distribution of churn and monthly charges.
  - Created a correlation matrix to understand relationships between contract duration, monthly charges, and total charges.
  - Built a **predictive churn model** and identified the **top 10 most impactful variables** for churn.
  - Used the article [How to Create a Churn Prediction Model](https://medium.com/neuronio-br/como-criar-um-modelo-para-predi%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-churn-aa11b9feb8a6) as a reference.

- **Data Visualization with Power BI & Tableau:**
  - Created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** showing services contracted by gender.
  - Developed a **Tableau dashboard** with insights on active vs. inactive customers, tenure, payment methods, and billing.
